 abstract = {In the Orienteering Problem (OP), we are given an undirected graph with edge weights and node prizes. The problem calls for a simple cycle whose total edge weight does not exceed a given threshold, while visiting a subset of nodes with maximum total prize. This NP-hard problem arises in routing and scheduling applications. We describe a branch-and-cut algorithm for finding an optimal OP solution. The algorithm is based on several families of valid inequalities. We also introduce a family of cuts, called conditional cuts, which can cut off the optimal OP solution, and propose an effective way to use them within the overall branch-and-cut framework. Exact and heuristic separation algorithms are described, as well as heuristic procedures to produce near-optimal OP solutions. An extensive computational analysis on several classes of both real-world and random instances is reported. The algorithm proved to be able to solve to optimality large-scale instances involving up to 500 nodes, within acceptable computing time. This compares favorably with previous published methods.

@article{Gunawan.2016,
 abstract = {The Orienteering Problem (OP) has received a lot of attention in the past few decades. The OP is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

@article{Hansen.2001,
 abstract = {Systematic change of neighborhood within a possibly randomized local search algorithm yields a simple and effective metaheuristic for combinatorial and global optimization, called variable neighborhood search (VNS). We present a basic scheme for this purpose, which can easily be implemented using any local search algorithm as a subroutine. Its effectiveness is illustrated by solving several classical combinatorial or global optimization problems. Moreover, several extensions are proposed for solving large problem instances: using VNS within the successive approximation method yields a two-level VNS, called variable neighborhood decomposition search (VNDS); modifying the basic scheme to explore easily valleys far from the incumbent solution yields an efficient skewed VNS (SVNS) heuristic. Finally, we show how to stabilize column generation algorithms with help of VNS and discuss various ways to use VNS in graph theory, i.e., to suggest, disprove or give hints on how to prove conjectures, an area where metaheuristics do not appear to have been applied before.},

@article{Kobeaga.2018,
 abstract = {This paper deals with the Orienteering Problem, which is a routing problem. In the Orienteering Problem each node has a profit assigned and the goal is to find the route that maximizes the total collected profit subject to a limitation on the total route distance. To solve this problem, we propose an evolutionary algorithm, whose key characteristic is to maintain unfeasible solutions during the search. Furthermore, it includes a novel solution codification for the Orienteering Problem, a novel heuristic for node inclusion in the route, an adaptation of the Edge Recombination crossover developed for the Travelling Salesperson Problem, specific operators to recover the feasibility of solutions when required, and the use of the Lin-Kernighan heuristic to improve the route lengths. We compare our algorithm with three state-of-the-art algorithms for the problem on 344 benchmark instances, with up to 7397 nodes. The results show a competitive behavior of our approach in instances of low-medium dimensionality, and outstanding results in the large dimensionality instances reaching new best known solutions with lower computational time than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

@article{Ramesh.1991,
 abstract = {Orienteering is a sport in which a competitor constructs a path from a start to a destination, visiting control points along the path. Each control point has a score (prize) associated with it, and there is a known amount of time (cost) for travel between control points. The problem is to select a path from the origin to the destination that maximizes the total prize such that the total cost of the path is less than a prescribed value. Applications of this problem are several, and arise in vehicle routing and production scheduling situations. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard, and several heuristics have been proposed in the literature. All these heuristics assume the cost function to be Euclidean, and exploit the underlying geometry. In this research, we consider general cost functions, and develop an efficient four-phase heuristic to solve the problem. The four phases are termed vertex insertion, cost improvement, vertex deletion and maximal insertions, respectively. The four phases are integrated within an algorithmic framework with five control parameters to guide the search process. The algorithm has been tested extensively, and has been evaluated against the heuristics from the literature for Euclidean cost functions and an exact procedure for general cost functions. The computational results show that the algorithm results in near-optimal solutions, and its computational requirements are minimal. We conclude from this research that the proposed algorithm is viable and efficient for solving practical problems with arbitrary cost functions.},

The algorithm is based on the Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic paradigm, and uses a clustering of the graph to operate on groups of nearby vertices. Extensive computational results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find very good solutions (it produced 27 new best known solutions on a set of benchmark instances) and that it fares favourably compared with other state-of-the-art heuristics when tested with both long and short computation time budgets.},

In this paper, we consider three variations of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and present the first algorithm solely based on VNS to solve the OP.

Moreover, it improves the best known results for several benchmark problems and reproduces the best results for others.},
